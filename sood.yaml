# General options relating to project type and the registration of objects.  For each option, you must select only one value 
# from the options shown.
####

project_style:

  # Defines the default structure of content metadata.  Set content_md_creation[:style] below if you want to bundle files into resources.
  # If should_register = false, the 'Process : Content Type' tag for each existing object will be examined.  If a known type is set in this tag,
  #  it will be used instead of the default below.
  content_structure: 'file'          # Like simple_image, but with <contentMetadata type="file"> and <resource type="file">.

                     
                                                      
  # Whether the pre-assembly process should register the objects.
  should_register: true   # Use if the objects are not yet registered

  # Pre-assembly must obtain a druid for every object.
  get_druid_from: 'manifest'           # Object's druid is in a column in the manifest called "druid".  Only used for should_register=false and use_manifest=true
                                       #   when you want to use a manifest for descriptive metadata, and when the folder container is not named by druid

# Paths to the pre-assembly input and output.
####

bundle_dir:  ~

staging_dir: ~               # Where to put the pre-assembled materials. This is
                             # where the assembly robots expect to find the assembled
                             # content. The default value is /dor/assembly and will be set automatically
                             # if you leave this as nil (~)
                             # Developers and tests may use this in special circumstances.
							               # A fully qualified path.

staging_style:    'copy'     # the staging style, can be "copy" or "symlink", defaults to "copy" if not specified or nil
                             #  if set to "copy" then all discovered files that need to be staged will be copied from the bundle directory to the staging directory
                             #  if set to "symlink", then all discovered files will be symlinked into the staging directory from the bundle directory
####
# Specify how pre-assembly should locate objects within the bundle_dir.
# Here we are discovering the object containers. An object container
# is either a single file or a single directory.
####

object_discovery:

  # Option 1: use a manifest.
  use_manifest: true    # If true, set glob and regex to nil.
                

  # Option 2: two-phase directory crawl.
  #
  #   - A glob pattern is used to find the object containers within the 'bundle_dir' set above.
  #     This pattern is passed to Ruby's Dir.glob(). 
  #     See http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Dir.html#method-c-glob
  #
  #   - Optionally, the results of that glob pattern can be filtered,
  #     retaining only the items matching the given regex (Ruby regular expression). 
  #     See http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html
  #
  # Both the glob and regex should be expressed in relative terms --
  # in other words, they do not include the bundle_dir.
  #
  # Various examples are shown.
#  glob:  '*'                                    # Everything.
#         '*.tif'                                # Only .tif files.
#
#  regex: ~                                      # No filtering.
#         '^[a-z][a-z]\d\d\d[a-z][a-z]\d\d\d\d$' # Only druid directories.
#         '^\d+$'                                # Only barcode directories.
#  
  
####
# Once object containers have been identified, specify which files within those
# containers should be staged (i.e., copied to the staging_dir).
####

stageable_discovery:

  # Option 1: If you set 'use_container' to true, this will simply stage the entire object directory that was matched with the glob above.
  # This is not a valid option if your object is contained in a folder named by druid or barcode - preassembly will give an error message if you set 
  # 'use_container' to true and the 'get_druid_from' parameter to 'container' or 'container_barcode'.
   
  use_container: true    # If true , set glob and regex to nil below.
                 

  # Option 2: If you set 'use_container' to false, staging will be done via a two-phase container crawl based on the glob and regex patterns specified below.
  #
  # The glob parameter can be used to flatten or partially flatten the input
  # directory structure. For example, consider this input structure:
  #
  #   aa111bb2222/
  #     00/
  #       1.tif
  #       2.tif
  #     01/
  #       1.jp2
  #       2.jp2
  #
  # If glob = '*', both the 00 and 01 subdirectories will be staged in
  # their entirely, preserving the original structure.
  #
  # If glob = '00', only the 00 subdirectory will be staged, preserving
  # its original structure.
  #
  # If glob = '00/*', only the files within 00 will be staged, which means
  # that the 00 subdirectory will not appear in the staged materials, as
  # shown here:
  #
  #    aa/111/bb/2222/
  #      1.tif
  #      2.tif
  #
  # As above, express the glob and regex in relative terms -- in 
  # this case, relative to the container.
  #
  #  Optionally, the results of that glob pattern can be filtered,
  #     retaining only the items matching the given regex (Ruby regular expression). 
  #     See http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html
  #
  # Various examples are shown.
  glob:  ~
         
  regex:  ~                       # No filtering.
         '(?ix) \. (tif|xml) $'  # Stage only items with .tif and .xml extentions.
  files_only:  true     # if set to true, then only files will be staged, regardless of glob specified above (i.e. any folders that match the glob will 
                        #  be ignored) -- this is useful to avoid duplication of staged files
                        #  if set to false or left off, then anything that matches the glob (and not filtered by regex) will be staged       

####
# Restrict objects to be accessioned when using the discovery method
####							               
accession_items:   ~         # Only valid for projects that do *not* use a manifest. 
                            # Used if you need to accession or re-accession only specific objects.
                            # You can supply a list of container names, and indicate if this list is exlcusionary
                            # or inclusionary.  In other words, do you want to *only* accession the named items, or accession
                            # everything *except* those listed? You can also specify if this is a re-accession, in which case the
                            # items will be reset (but not unregistered from DOR) before accessioning again.
                            # If you specify ~, all items will be accessioned and you can leave off the "only" and "except" parameters.
                            # Note that you will probably also want to log this new run using a different progress log file.  
                            # In the "only" and "except" list, you should use names that exactly match the folder names in your bundle_dir,
                            # one per line, indented under "only" or "except" and preceeded by a dash as shown in the examples below.
                            # If 'should_register: true', and you want to run a re-accession, then you should create a new manifest file (see the README)
                            # For a normal run (or if 'should_register: true'), set "accession_items" to ~, which will process all items.  
                            # Note that you can run a full re-accession for all items by simply leaving off the "only" and "except" lists, but
                            # still specifying a "reaccession: true".  Do not specify both "only" and "except" unless you like flying experimental homebuilt aircraft.
                            # Examples below:
  #only:
#    - 'aa111aa1111'
#    - 'bb222bb2222'              # this is an example of two objects that will be accessioned, put them one per line, prefixed by a space, a dash, and space, add quotes around each item
#  except:
#    - 'aa111aa1111'
#    - 'bb222bb2222'             # this is an example of two objects that will be ignored, put them one per line, prefixed by a space, a dash, and space, add quotes around each item
# 
#  reaccession: true            # If running a re-accession, set this to true so that a cleanup will be performed, if this is a first accession attempt for these objects, set it to false or ~ or leave it off                       
#                               # If set to true, the the files will be removed for /dor/assembly, /dor/workspace and the stacks before accessioning again.  Objects will *not* be re-registered, so this only works with
#                               #  should_register=false
